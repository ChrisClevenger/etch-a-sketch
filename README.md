Etch A Sketch Project initially created during The Odin Project 

Focusing primarily upon JavaScript and CSS. Will have an adjustable grid 
and will allow the user to toggle between black and rgb colors. Focusing
on initial functionality before moving into style. 

The goal is to be as efficient and succinct as possible with js--while
making helpful comments for legibility.
